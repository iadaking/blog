```
Caused by: java.lang.IllegalStateException: Unable to complete the scan for annotations for web application [] due to a StackOverflowError. Possible root causes include a too low setting for -Xss and illegal cyclic inheritance dependencies. The class hierarchy being processed was [org.bouncycastle.asn1.ASN1EncodableVector->org.bouncycastle.asn1.DEREncodableVector->org.bouncycastle.asn1.ASN1EncodableVector]
```



in my case the `org.bouncycastle.asn1.DEREncodableVector` class, which was causing the cyclic dependency, was served by two jars in the class path.

```
bcprov-jdk15on-1.47.jar` and `bcprov-jdk16-1.45.jar
```

Excluded the unwanted jar(bcprov-jdk16-1.45.jar) and it worked well

在 .idea 文件下 libraries 文件下搜索到上述所描述的jar依赖。
